# Setting up your network and firewall on Windows

>**Note:** All instructions of this page apply to Windows only.

To enable a proper connection of the Live Capture apps with the Unity Editor:

-   Ensure that your client device and your Unity Editor workstation have access to the same network.

-   Disable any active VPNs.

-   On Windows 10:
  * Make sure the Wi-Fi network you are using is [set to Private](#private-wi-fi-network-setup).
  * In the Unity Editor, use the Connections window to [automatically configure your firewall](#automatic-firewall-configuration).
  * If you still can’t connect, [manually configure your firewall](#manual-firewall-rule-configuration). with a dedicated rule.

## Private Wi-Fi network setup

1.  In the Windows Settings, select **Network & Internet**.
